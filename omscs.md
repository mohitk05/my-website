<h1>My OMSCS Journey</h1>

In 2020 I decided to apply for Georgia Tech's Online Master of Science in Computer Science, a.k.a. OMSCS. I wanted to be a part of a formal graduate program and GaTech made this possible via OMSCS. My first semester was in Fall 2021 and am currently in the program. This place is to collect all my notes, writings and progress in OMSCS, inspired from [Niladri Roy](https://omscs.royniladri.dev/).
