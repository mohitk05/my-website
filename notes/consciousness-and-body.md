## Body

- Cognition afforded and constrained by body
- Body in driving - embodied cognition
  - Situated cognition - cognition is situated in the world (react to environment)
    - E.g. ping pong robot
    - Look at human behaviour
    - Ball comes to us, we react, not much thinking
    - Aka situated action
    - Environment shapes behaviour
    - Bartender keeps memory of drinks - use spatial location of the bar to remember
  - Distributed cognition: deliberately move cognition to external world
    - E.g. cars: lot of information is given by the car.
- Boundary of cognition? - depends on different kinds of cognition
