## Brain

- Brain has 4 major parts
- If brain is so descriptively known, why mind?
- Comparison with cell phones - made up of hardware, but the behaviour cannot be explained with hardware - another level of abstraction
- [The neurons that shaped civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l80zgw07W4Y)
  - Mirror neurons - subset of mirror neurons: Send signal to do the same thing when we see other person doing an action
  - Culture and civilization: people imitated and emulated other people's actions, e.g. fire, tool making.
  - Polar bear takes 1000s of years to develop fur, humans imitate by seeing elders wearing fur to protect from cold
  - Empathise touch, but skin receptors say don't worry it's not an actual touch
  - Humans "connected" in a way
- Mirror neurons (biological evolution) ↔ imitation, empathy (cognitive evolution) ↔ civilization (cultural evolution)
- Extending CRUM (computer representational understanding of mind)

## Emotions

- Mental and physiological state associated with feelings
- Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions: (+ and -)
  - joy and sadness
  - acceptance and disgust
  - fear and anger
  - surprise and anticipation
- **Theories**
  - James-Lange
    - First physiological arousal -> emotion
  - Cannon-Bard
    - Physiological and emotions come together
  - Schachter-Singer
    - Physiological arousal -> think -> emotion
  - Lazarus
    - Think -> both
- Stress
  - Eustress: short-term, positive
  - Distress: short or long negative
  - Hyperstress: More for one person to handle
  - Hypostress: Less, bored
- Optimal stress: eustress
- Emotions in CRUM?
  - Emotion as concentration of attention
  - Short-term and long-term memory
  - Emotion leads to allocation of resources to a single thing (e.g. fear)
  - Emotion focuses on one task and puts it in the short-term memory to give it the highest attention (appraisal - focus - action).
