This is a intelligence test that many of us might have encountered at some point of time in our life - in aptitude or cognitive tests. The test consists of questions that show a grid of images, they could be 4 or 6 in all, and one of the images is left blank for the responder to fill in. They are presented with a set of choices to choose from - the answer should make logical sense when placed in the question set.
