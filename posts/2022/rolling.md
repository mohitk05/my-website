The Cab Driver from Iraq 2

The Cab Driver from Iraq

It was a cold, grey day in Berlin. It was a Saturday. I was getting ready to go to an event organised by an Indian group in Berlin. It was the festival of Gudhi Padwa. As per the Hindu calendar, this day marked the start of a new year and is celebrated throughout various parts of India. I was well prepared - a traditional dress including a kurta was washed and ironed. I was worried though how it will handle the cold outside. So I decided to add an extra thermal layer inside.

Even though everything was in place, I was late as usual. I have something leaving on time. Finally, I decided to take a cab to the venue instead. The cab driver arrived, I got into the can and we took off.

I was conscious about the traditional Indian dress I was wearing, I was expecting some stared, if not curious questions. But I got none, surprisingly. The driver asked me where I was from, a good ice-breaker in a city like Berlin, where there are a lot of immigrants from different parts of the world. I mentioned I was from India. From Mumbai, specifically.

“Ahh, Mumbbaai!”, he exclaimed. “Amitabh Bacchan, Raja Hindustani”. “I like these very much - achha, achha”. I smiled, I had heard these quite a few times before. Bollywood remains to be a major part of the Indian perception in foreign lands, apart from the food obviously. “Where are you from?” I asked him. “I am from Iraq”, he told me. “Oh! Nice. What’s your name, by the way?” “Khaled”. “Oh yes.” I had forgotten that I had read his name while booking the cab.

A few moments passed. I gazed at the ‘almost grey’ sky outside and the light Saturday traffic. I was about to break the ice once again with the most popular topic - the weather but then decided to use the other one.

“So how long have you been here?” I asked Khaled. “20-30 years almost. I came here with my family when America entered Iraq.” He mentioned. “Oh! 20 years, that’s a long time, you must be a German by now” I pointed out. “How are things in Iraq now?” I asked. “I do not know much, I have no relative there now. Everyone is here, and I’ve lost touch with my friends.” Khaled told me in broken English. I tried making sense of what he was saying and gave him constant feedback that I was understanding what he was saying through my nodding.

“Do you speak German?” He asked, continuing the conversation. “No, not yet. I can understand only a handful of utility words - eine, zwei, eingang, ausgang” I had tried learning German (as does every newcomer in Berlin), and I want to even, but Berlin makes you comfortable here by now requiring you to learn Deutsch. Almost everyone speaks some English.
“You should learn some, it’s really helpful”
“Yes, I’m trying to. But it seems difficult, no?” I mentioned.
“Ahh, yes. So much detail. Like if I have to say ‘one car’ it is ‘das auto’ but if there is more than one car, it is ‘die autos’. I had roughly read about this peculiarity of German. The usage of the word ‘the’ varied as per the ‘subject’ in the picture. Khaled went on to rant a bit about the language, giving me further examples from objects inside the car - the mobile holder, a bottle - about how some grammar rules seemed odd.

I find it interesting how language, which works as a tool to connect people by allowing them to express themselves, can also connect people via its own difficulty and sometimes inefficacy. We went on to talk about the German language and I made a mental note to learn the language soon.

“I’m going to an Indian festival today, it is the Indian new year.” I was enjoying the conversation so I did not hesitate to volunteer to keep it going. “Ah, new year?” “Yes, as during January 1, new year” I explained. “Oh, so all of India celebrates this new year?” I usually refrain from mentioning details around such topics as I’m sure that they’d cause confusion.

To make it clearer, Gudhi Padwa is a Hindu festival and is particularly celebrated in Maharashtra. A few other places also celebrate this day but with different names, e.g. Ugadi in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. So I tried explaining Khaled in the simplest way possible.

“It is a Hindu festival and it is celebrated mostly by a people living near Mumbai.”
“Ahh, okay. You are a Hindu?” Khaled asked me.

Now, religion is a risky topic to have conversations about with a stranger you met ten minutes ago. It is riskier when they are probably from a religion that has historically been in a feud with yours. “Yes”, I answered.

“India has problems no? Hindu, Muslim fight with each other” I nodded to another common fact known about India, especially lately. “It is usually the politicians, they say you and you are different, not the same” Khaled expressed his strong opinions by swaying his fingers in the air as if he was one of those stereotypical ‘politicians’ you read about who create a divide among the people.

“Normal people fight because politicians tell them to, it’s all politics.” I gave him an agreeing nod, the one which portrays empathy and is an expression for ‘sad, but true. I usually do not like taking extreme sides on topics like these, but given the reality of the situation, a 20-minute cab ride wasn’t exactly the right place for a political debate.
“Yeah, it’s mostly for votes and coming to power. I don’ think people really hate each other.” I added.
“In Iran, there are two types of Muslims fighting against each other. The politicians say one is better than the other.” Khaled went on.

I realised that I’ve seen this opinion has been the most popular one in several places. It was hardly the masses against each other, but a special few who created havoc in the society. This thought somehow managed to pass-by by my mind in that short span of time while talking to Khaled.

I wanted to know more about Iraq, from an Iraqi, however briefly it was possible. “Have you been to Iraq afterwards?”
“Ahh, Greece! Greece is an amazing country, you should definitely visit!” Khaled cut me off, pointing to something outside the car that reminded him of Greece. I tried looking for that something, but could not find it. Khaled’s English was difficult to be interpreted under the cloak of excitement. Maybe it was some old memory from Greece?

I smiled, nodding and assuring him that I will visit Greece one day.
“I have no one in Iraq. All my friends are here, no contact there” he came back to my question. I am, at times, bad at making quality conversations, and this was proof. I tend to forget some details one has already mentioned and then go on embarrassingly to ask about the exact same thing again. Khaled’s answer reminded me of my forgetfulness. But gladly, he did not mind.

“America is like a politician, it makes people fight against each other and then bam-bam-bam-bam, all destroyed” Khaled demonstrated his hate for the US quite literally, combining his hands to animate the scenes of explosions. I understood what he meant, I had recently read about the history of a few countries facing adverse conditions in the present due to a few decisions of world powers in the past.

We were nearing the destination. Berlin’s April weather is a phenomenon in itself. The weather changes so fast that one minute it is raining, a few minutes later it snows and then suddenly it is all sunny. I think it had been on-and-off sunny quite a few times since we left my place. This April weather at times plays with time for you, you think a lot of time has passed only to find out it has been a few minutes.

— come back here.

On The Boundaries

If any city has seen a literal division of its region into two halves, Berlin has to be the most popular and recent one. I wasn’t aware of the historical events that shaped Berlin before I moved here. It was just another unpopular capital of a popular country for me.

I was introduced to the famous Berlin wall when I decided to look up the history of this city. My school history lessons were outdated enough to not cover anything beyond the mid-twentieth century mark. It seemed that history ended with the Indian independence. I was aware of the events during the second world war and all the human calamities in Europe, but there was a small section for the Cold War which I had mysteriously skipped.

I shouldn’t be complaining anyway about not having Cold War as an extensive chapter in my history syllabus. I think there is a limit to how much history can be included to be studied in schools. My syllabus started right from the first humans on earth - when I was in 5th grade and went up to the post-World War 2 era in the contemporary world in my 10th grade. There’s already so much that was missed out on, e.g. the American native history, the African invasions and exploitation - all of these were either introduced via movies or some eager encyclopedia searches.

It also boils down to relevance, right? Why would an Indian teenager be interested in what happened thousands of miles away to native Americans, or in remote parts of Africa when there was an enormous amount of material available in Indian history alone? But if you are European, the Cold War was a significant period for you in history. And if you are German, it might have also impacted you personally.

Cold War was an interesting period in history because it wasn’t an actual war, but the world was on the “brink of a war”. Imagine living in a constant worry that another World War may break out when you are having your peaceful dinner, watching your daily soap. This “probable war” was between the Eastern and the Western front, quite literally each signifying the respective part of the world. How conveniently had the world split apart? The most painful split was in Germany though - the dividing line ran right through the country, forming the eastern “German Democratic Republic (GDR)” and the western “West Germany”.

To complicate the matters, Berlin became an island territory which had its own East and West parts. It’s quite interesting how this came to be, but if you see the map of “Germany” during this period, you’d notice Berlin as a scaled-down replica of the whole country. Berlin had its own dividing line, which later also had a wall built over it - famously known as the Berlin wall.

The “war” wasn’t only a collision of military forces but was also a fight between ideologies. The East vs the West, communism vs democracy. On one side was the Red Army enforcing a communist society, promising jobs for all, with a community-driven economic growth. And on the other hand was the American idea of “equality” and fundamental rights for all - a society run by the people, for the people. I consider this as one of the biggest human experiments that ran for the second half of the twentieth century, and since there was no traditional war, these ideologies permeated deep within the societies, the geographies and the psychology of the regions part of this experience.

I live in the eastern part of Berlin - Friedrichshain. It is still not the far east, you will have to walk straight down the street that I live on to reach the Lichtenberg district, which is visibly “east”. If you walk up in the opposite direction, you’ll reach te Warschauer Strasse station, and a few meters away would be the remnants of the former Berlin Wall, alongside the river Spree.

Walking upto Frankfurter Tor and then taking a left on [] Strasse will start a nice trip through the former Eastern part of Berlin, towards the Western part. Wide landscapes of grass and straight streets mark the planned Eastern Block. The buildings are particularly boxy, and usually white. They stand by each other at regular intervals of green grass and streets. The side that faces the street is the same as the one that faces the other buildings behind.

The glass windows are uniform across each side of the buildings. They are evenly spaced, of equal size, though some are tinted now with red, green and yellow. They almost seem like pixels on a screen, each sheltering a family and its world within. The communist agenda was to maximise national, or rather societal growth by optimising resources. The buildings were constructed by the State, offered at very cheap rates and were designed in a way so that every square foot of the are was put to good use.

Today I attended my first office party, or at least the first of its kind. It was at a nice outdoor venue, making complete use of the rare Berlin sun. We had a few drinks, some finger food, and nice, long chats about work and whatnot. I took the U-Bahn back home, the U6, and then the U5.

I love the public transport in Berlin. Maybe my opinion does not even matter for a transport system that boasts of being among the top three in the world. It is extensively spread and you can hop onto trams, buses, and the S/U Bahns and you’ll reach a few meters away from your destination, wherever it be. It also becomes a part of the city’s identity gradually - the iconic chimes of U-Bahn, the voice of “Zurück bleiben bitte” (Stay back, please), and the thuds of doors shutting at each station - mark Berlin’s existence.

The U5 is my daily commute when I have to travel into the city center. It runs from my stop, Frankfurter Tor, and goes up to the Hauptbahnof, the Berlin Central Station. It passes through some popular stops like Alexanderplatz, Museumsinsel, and Brandenburger Tor and is a great way for me to get to the popular places. I believe every line in public transport has its own essence - a peculiarity that uniquely identifies the route. Usually, it is because of the people that travel daily on that line, what is public transport without the public?

Before getting on the U5 today I had taken the U6. It was my second time on this line and I could feel the difference from my usual U5 experience. The U5 goes through several touristy places and areas that have workplaces where people commute daily. I think this makes U5 void of any caracter of its own as it becomes busy accommodating people from various backgrounds.

But U6 was different. There was more life to it. I often try to compare Berlin to Mumbai, the other big city I’ve lived in for a large part of my life. Though Mumbai has fewer routes than Berlin, the importance and the effect of public transport on people’s lives remains the same. I remember the harbour line, the sub-urban rail line that connects the newer parts of Mumbai to the southern, more rooted Mumbai. U6 has more life and I feel it during my short trip.

I get down at Unter Den Linden, an iconic station situated in the city center. It is important for me in many ways, but today, it acts as a connecting station to change from U6 to U5. I, and a few others, get off from the U6 to continue on the U5, trying hard to represent the U6 vibe in the cosmopolitan U5.

When the train arrives, I get a seat just besides the door. It is an old-style carriage with seats aligned perpendicular to the direction of the train motion. The newer trains have them parallel, giving them the popular metro feeling. This one feels more like S-Bahn, or the old New York subways.

There’s not much to do on short subway journeys, I usually am impatient for my stop to arrive. I love the longer train journeys, it is the short ones that make me restless, I am not sure why.

At times in the U-Bahn, you might notice a drunk person, or some unfortunate ones who do not have a shelter over them, asking for some monetary help. On this trip too, there was a person so drunk that they forgot where to lean themselves. So they chose the passenger sitting in front of them. This, naturally, invited some stares. The man sitting next to me even stood up to peek into the scene and validate his assumption that something was off.

Amidst all of this U-Bahn chaos, I saw her through the wide window of the train as it slowed down at a station. The moving train and the crowd outside only allowed a few glimpses, but her glittery dress somehow held my attention through the gaps. The doors opened, a man entered and then she followed. I tried hiding my attempts to catch a complete look of her face - she was strikingly beautiful, or was it the wine I had at the office party speaking? She was wearing a black sweater which had glitter sewn into its strands and the train lights made it shine like a disco ball.
