Compound Types
Ways to create structures from the primitive types. Usually every language provides 3 ways to do so:

-   Each-of type: This type has each of every type t1, t2, t3...tn.
-   One-of: This type is one of types t1 or t2 or t3 or...tn.
-   Recursive (self-referencing): This type references itself. E.g. tree, list

Syntactic Sugar
Keep the language core small. Tuples are special records with keys are position numbers.
