> **NOTE** I usually write my blogs at my own pace. So you may find the blog going into various directions because that's how my thoughts would have wandered while writing. Also, this post might trigger some of your beliefs, so read with caution.

Most of us might have experienced a situation where a website displays an ad about something which you recently talked about, or searched for on the internet. As people in tech, some of us might be aware of the engineering behind this. I recently read about a lot of marketing related tools and ways in which they modify our online experience and smartly slide a personalised ad. This post pens down a line of thought I had mostly while in shower, but also later after pondering a bit.

For those who wonder how these ads work, here's a simple explaination. When you visit some product or business website, they contain something called **pixels**. These are literally 1px \* 1px transparent images which are placed on the website, and essentially are invisible, but do one important thing. Their url points to a particular ad platform url and when the website loads, it also loads this pixel, and inturn loads all the cookies related to that ad platform.

These cookies remember that you visited the product website but did not make a purchase. So next time you visit a website where there are ads, if those ads are being provided by the same ad platform that had its pixel previously, the ad container would now show the ad of the product you just visited.
