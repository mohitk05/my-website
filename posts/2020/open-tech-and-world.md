> **NOTE** I usually write my blogs at my own pace. So you may find the blog going into various directions because that's how my thoughts would have wandered while writing. Also, this post might trigger some of your beliefs, so read with caution. While writing this I'm doubting myself more. When I read this after a few years, I hope that my core ideologies remain the same, or it would be a huge joke.

Most of us might have experienced a situation where a website displays an ad about something which you recently talked about, or searched for on the internet. As people in tech, some of us might be aware of the engineering behind this. I recently read about a lot of marketing related tools and ways in which they modify our online experience and smartly slide-in a personalised ad. This post pens down a line of thought I had mostly while in shower, but also later after pondering a bit.

For those who wonder how these ads work, here's a simple explaination. When you visit some product or business website, they contain something called **pixels**. These are literally 1px \* 1px transparent images which are placed on the website, and essentially are invisible, but do one important thing. Their url points to a particular ad platform url and when the website loads, it also loads this pixel, and in-turn loads all the cookies related to that ad platform.

These cookies remember that you visited the product website but did not make a purchase. So next time you visit a website where there are ads, if those ads are being provided by the same ad platform that had its pixel previously, the ad container would now show the ad of the product you just visited. This, in marketing, is called remarketing campaign. You are able to keep the user hooked to your product even when they have exited your platform.

I had a few intense discussions around how ads creep in the most unexpected ways today, and all of us might also be aware of various data-breaches happening where user data is sold for, sometimes, a huge sum of money. The cost of data related to how I browse the internet and specify my choices is one of the costliest thing today on the internet.

Digital data has only strengthened and supplemented the underlying concept which broadly sums up marketing - _catching people's minds, and making them buy your thing_. Marketing and free markets have been there for very long - please don't mark me as a member of any particular wing - I'm simply pondering over a thought. Before the internet, it was door-to-door sales, or telephone cold calls. You went directly to your customers and told them they could buy this thing, but if you were clever you would make them believe they needed your thing.

A very good example of such marketing is how Pepsodent entered into the market with their 'toothpaste'. I read this interesting case while reading the book **The Power of Habit** by . The book describes how after failing to enter the market, Pepsodent employed brightest of minds which devised this fantastic marketing campaign which led to immense product acceptance and creation of the so-called need. People back then did not use toothpaste at all, in fact there was never a need for it. Pepsodent introduced people to something called **enamel** - a yellow coating which is naturally present on our teeth which kind of makes our teeth look dull.

'White, shining teeth' is what they would have advertised, I think. People started buying toothpaste, something which they had ignored when advertised for the first time. Enamel was something which was a naturally occuring thing, but for some reason, having white teeth was glorified and people now wanted to buy anything that could make their teeth whiter. These amazing marketing campaigns are something which I often dislike.

Ads have been disguising people into buying things since way back. Internet has only strengthened this. I do not want to bash all the existing ideas, but want you to take a step back and think. Internet has only empowered advertisers to be perfectly disguised while talkign about their product. The most successful ad - they say - is the one which does not seem like an ad. Something which connects to people directly and they naturally buy the thing.
