I have long wanted to study computer science, right from the basics. This is a log of the steps I've taken, majorly following some popular self-learning curriculums. Most of these are from [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com).
Start date: 3 April 2020

<h2>Ongoing Learnings</h2>

### [Computer Organisation - Nand2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome)

Hours: ~ 72 (6 \* 6 weeks) \* 2 courses

-   Very beginner-friendly
-   Progresses gradually, layer by layer
-   A few parts similar to microprocessors course I had done in college
-   Tools are easy to use
-   A small idea about programming will help understand the technicalities quickly - like HDL, etc.

### [Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

Around 2 months to complete

-   A bit theoretical, much required
-   Language agnostic
-   WIP
