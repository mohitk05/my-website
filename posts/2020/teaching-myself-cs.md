I have long wanted to study computer science, right from the basics. This is a log of the steps I've taken, majorly following some popular self-learning curriculums. Most of these are from [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com).

Start date: 3 April 2020

## Progress

| Course                                                                                                  | Score   |

| [Computer Organisation - Nand2Tetris](https://coursera.org/share/35f1e26c14805ea77e12bca39a35de08)      | 98.30%  |
| [DS & Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)                                  | Ongoing |
| [Intro to Mathematics for CS](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics)            | Ongoing |
| [Parallel, Concurrent & Distributed Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp) | Ongoing |
| [Programming Languages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)                           | Ongoing |

Doing these courses are opening up new fields for me and I am able to relate these concepts to the work I do on a daily basis. At times, these also improve the way I think and design a solution.
