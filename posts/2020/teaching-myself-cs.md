I have long wanted to study computer science, right from the basics. This is a log of the steps I've taken, majorly following some popular self-learning curriculums. Most of these are from [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com).

Start date: 3 April 2020

Doing these courses are opening up new fields for me and I am able to relate these concepts to the work I do on a daily basis. At times, these also improve the way I think and design a solution.
