For the past year, I have been working on growth products at upgrad.com, which include the marketing platform that is responsible to bring in potential paid customers. Prior to this, I had majorly worked on feature-heavy web applications like admin apps or internal tools. What differs in a marketing website is that the number of features is very less (I'm being too generic here) but there are other factors that play an important role in making the product a success.

The major focus of such a website is to give a smooth, fast experience to someone landing on a page. A happy first experience increases the chances of things moving forward in terms of revenue and overall interest in the actual product offering.
