A few days back, I got an idea for a game. I am going to document the process here. I've noticed that a lot of times I get an idea, I go full on into building the thing. This time, I'm trying something<!-- excerpt --> different - let's go slow and steady. I'll also learn a few new things throughout the process. Let's begin! And BTW, the game is called **Aboard**.

Fun fact: US has so many same city names as Europe!
