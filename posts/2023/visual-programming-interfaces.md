I recently gave a short talk at MeshCon 2023 in Berlin on _Visual Programming Interfaces_. The event was organised by OpnTec and Fossasia and included several talks on variety of topics, the idea being “meshing of ideas”. My topic was inspired from a mixture of motivations as well - an old project, recent studies in human-computer interaction and my increasing interest in tools for thought for the future of programming.

One of my first introductions to writing “programs” on a computer was PowerPoint. It might sound strange but I had received an assignment to create a presentation about a social science topic when in school. There was ample time given so I completely nerded out on the software. I added sounds to each slide, created a theme, added animations and automatic slide transitions. 

Things changes drastically when I discovered a feature in PowerPoint - hyperlinking slides. I started with linking slides to create “sections” in the presentation so that people could directly skip to a particular one. Then it struck me that I could use this powerful feature to create a quiz-like interaction at the end of the presentation. So anyone who is watching it, or as a group, could test their knowledge. I created a bunch of slides with questions and four answer choices. Then I created two slides - a “yay you are correct” slide and a “oops that was wrong”. Then it was only linking the right answer to the “yay” slide and all the wrong answers to the “oops” one. It was my first experience with “conditional logic” which had a real application!

PowerPoint, with its hyper linking feature, is a visual programming environment.
